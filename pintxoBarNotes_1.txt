It helps Food: with order particularly if tou want to get several pintxos at once. But its not my style. They are also sticklers for people sitting as opposed to the typical free for all.

While the choices are great the have systemtized order via a nimber system.  You can pick out want you want via number on pre printed sheets that double as a menue.

Although we did not get it today, I have had the txiporona brochette served with ink sauce.  I am told it is the best in the city for that. They have various others including lamb brochettes.

What a coincidence.  Got to tell them about our part in the great resignation!  The place it self is a quaint little spot, at least down in the bar.  Full resturant upstairs but I have not been. They had Food: several novel offerings.  Although i did not get it they had a small txuleta pintxo that looked great. My little veggie cracker was actually on a bed of philo dough.  Very good. Cecilia got a mini tartaleta hongos.

Casa Vergara							2022-02-16		Parte beja 12:30 20220216 Cana jamón tomate y queso - 6 *great choices *best croquettes Food: Fun inside atmo.  Poppy jazzy US music. A bit fancier then the typical pintxo bar. The choices are great.  Lots of them and of different types.  Gives options if you are getting a bit tired of the staples - not that you could. They even had the sea urchant *insert relavance here. Ask for a menu for hot ones.  They even have a guy with the ccheif hat. Minu oyster bar and lots of seating for full meal. Also the croquettes are cooked to order, not microwaved.
Donostiarra							2022-03-18		20220318 18h30 Parte vajha Cana y empanada - 5.20 *good selection *very creative Note that evening aperitivo starts at 7:30. While, it has been a while.  Incapacitated for more than a week by my short comings, I am fianally back at it.  This fisrt place out is a pretty cool twist, I guess 2020 hip is what comes to mind. It has a sign that says there is no wifi - talk to each other. Food: Got to get off my phone. A bit fancy or different it offer pintxos plus a cheese selection and oyster bar. Still not too pricey. They also have a gintonaria.  Coming back for that!  And 12 monkeys memorabilia on the wall.

As is a lot of their pintxos. If you really want the best, you need to wait until they run out of something (which they will do quickly) and then replace it with crusants right out of the oven. The best. At night it is packed but it is one of my favorite places to sit and order one thing after another.  Really a great selection all over.

Goiz Argi							2022-03-02		20220302 20h00 Parte vajha Drink: Caña y pintxo con jamón, champiñones, peminto y huevo - 6.10 Nice little place. Good selection particularly if you look at the board for hot options.  There is a good charicter here that is difficult to verbalize, but it is overly expensive, particularly for the small beer pour. Although Cecilia got something unique that she rather liked.
Gorriti Taberna							2022-01-15		11:30 on 20220115 Old town San Lorenzo Food: Pepper tortilla and a Cana - 4.80 Vibe: *classic basque One of my favorite places, and right next to my home. When it just opens on Saturday there are really great offerings and just enough people to add some life.  Clearly a lot of regulars hit it up at this time.  Although it is one of the few places I have seen in the old town that keeps a reasonable offering all day. I have been here a dozen times because it is so close to my home and i like the view to people watch, but I always seemed to get charged something different.
Heme retzi							2022-04-08		20220408 22h00 Creantha y jamón y queso - 6.10 Food: Very bright, very white. Pintxo bar crossed with a very small seafood restaurant.  You can actually Food: pick out the fresh seafood you want and watch them cook it up.  As a pintxo bar, it is pretty typical.  For some reason this place eluded us for weeeks.  We kept going sown the weong streets.  Cecilia got a cheese cake.  Although expensive, it was very interesting.  A true cheesy gureair inside!  Not your typical US cheese cake. All together, very expensive. Same group as the one star.
Igeldo jatetxea							2022-02-03		20220203 port by la concha Txakoli y Gilda - 4.8 *great view Food: No beer on tap and a bit expensive for pintxos.  Most things come in multiples ñile raciones or full plates.  But the view to peer is fantastic and it is the only seaside place open right now - maybe due to the season or covid.

Itxar Pena							2022-03-18		20220318 19h00 Parte vajha Food: Cana y tortilla de ropa vieja 5.70 *good selection A bit more upscale place.  I was first brought here for a plate of the mushrooms. Today I went with Food: a tortilla of ropa vieja- this last part (old clothes) refers to leftovers.  It is not leftovers:) tortilla is a thin one, but perfectly cooked with it runny just on the inside.
Izkina							2022-02-28		20220228 21h30 parte vajha Drink: Zurito y pintxo chestora 4.70 Drink: Decent choices at this pintxo/ cafeateria place.  I went with the zurito as opposed to a full pour Drink: caña.  My conversion is now complete!  Needing smaller beers to more effectively move from one Food: pintxo bar to the next! Cecilia got a really good leak quishe like thing. Pintxo s were on the high side of price 20220301 12:30 Off the boulevard Drink: Caña y borrato con jamon y quoaso 5,40 Several tables outside and on a terrace.  Sitting outside guves you sercice at you seat, they prefer Food: that to you ordering at the bar if you are not sitting inside.  Minimal pintxo choices but they, one beer, cider only if you get the whole bottle.  They do have a full bar and coffee.  They also had ceisonts and several types of coffe cakes.  Not my place, but ok. Pricy

Food: A resturant pintxo a lace with several good options on the table, the board and the csrd.  The bollo was cery good, crisp and even a bit spicy for spain. Cecilia got a croquette and it was very goood for the price.  Still crunch and the cheese on the inside actually had some flavor!  For fun they throw a peice of jamon under the crocette. Tender is nice, seems to be regulars. Great price Food: for on pintxo made in the moment
Kukurruku							2022-03-06		20220306 13h30 Parte vajha Drink: Caña y croquetas- 4.00 *best croquettes Vibe: *classic Food: In this little basque bar, the quintessential pintxo bar thatbis often over flowing with older Spanish dudes at Aperotivo time, they offer Croquetas (and other fryables) that are cooked right to order. Very good. Also they do chickens to go off the rotisserie.  I will try for next Sundayunch and let tou know - got one, very good, comes with its own juces in a beer bottle. My kind of a protest! 20220306 13h30 Parte vajha Txocoli y bollo de carne *creative offerings good quality If decedence was a place you could walk into, this is it. It actually had a Micheleen star.  Great serving sizes, all kinds of creative stuff.  Not just seafood either! A hiden secret - ham and cheese in a fried container. Oh ya.

The pintxo selección is not large but it is diverse.  Mostly various topimgs on bread.  Some really good stuff. They also have fried gambas.

Ordizia							2022-04-05		20220405 12:30 Parte vajha Drink: Caña Bollo con carne - 4.20 Definitely not a tourist place.  A small place filled with regulars.

Paco Bueno							2022-01-23		Old town 20220123 Drink: Caña y gamba - 4.40 *best gamba Food: Best fried shrimp pintxo place in town.  I remember this place from my first vist 7 years ago but it Food: tool me (actually my wife) a few weeks to redecover.  Pintxos are a flat rate at 2 each and it is mostly sea food.  The shrimp has a thick breading but it is still light and crispy.  Still hot too.  Even after the afternoon rush they still have plenty.  I think the fry the sheimp all day long
Picaro									Drink: Caña y gilda - 4.90 Over the bridge and near the beach i found a corner with several small bars. I stoped at one Food: which was more if a small restaurant then a pintxo bar.  Has nice little outside space but I am not sure if the sun would ever shine directly here given the taller buildings and narrow street.  Maybe at high noon.  I am a little depressed today and I am trying to remind my self how Lucky i am, at least Until the bank takes the last lf our miney. Service was a bit slow and I felt ignored, the bread and cheese were dried out. The outside is Food: nice.  The menu has a list of pintxos not on display, with the cheapest being croquettes at 2.50.  I like to go with whats in the case and right now I am trying to train myself into enjoying fish. The Vibe: Gildas are a local clasic and easy for me given the vinegary peppers.
Pub txurrut							2022-02-03		20220203 1h. Parte vejha square Drink: Caña - 3 Some how this place has no food.  It is odd given how early it is. Not coming back here.
